        # Enables inline evaluation of resources in provider actions.
        #
        # Without this option, any resources declared inside the LWRP are added
        # to the resource collection after the current position at the time the
        # action is executed. Because they are added to the primary resource
        # collection for the chef run, they can notify other resources outside
        # the LWRP, and potentially be notified by resources outside the LWRP
        # (but this is complicated by the fact that they don't exist until the
        # provider executes). In this mode, it is impossible to correctly set the
        # updated_by_last_action flag on the parent LWRP resource, since it
        # executes and returns before its component resources are run.
        #
        # With this option enabled, each action creates a temporary run_context
        # with its own resource collection, evaluates the action's code in that
        # context, and then converges the resources created. If any resources
        # were updated, then this provider's new_resource will be marked updated.
        #
        # In this mode, resources created within the LWRP cannot interact with
        # external resources via notifies, though notifications to other
        # resources within the LWRP will work. Delayed notifications are executed
        # at the conclusion of the provider's action, *not* at the end of the
        # main chef run.
        #
        # This mode of evaluation is experimental, but is believed to be a better
        # set of tradeoffs than the append-after mode, so it will likely become
        # the default in a future major release of Chef.
